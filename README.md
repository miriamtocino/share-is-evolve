Project Description
=======
Personal Website of Software Engineer Jose Antonio Escribano [shareisevolve.com](http://shareisevolve.com/).

Below you find a list of important information and details, that I use on a daily basis, or I will need in the future if I haven't worked on the project for a long time â˜º

Getting Started
=======

## Cloning the repository

To clone the repository open the terminal, go to the projects folder and paste the code below.

`git clone git@github.com:miriamtocino/share-is-evolve.git share-is-evolve`

After that and first of all, both **node** and **bower** dependencies need to be installed:

```bash
npm install

bower install
```

After this two operations are done, node need to be activated:

```bash
nvm use
```

Congratulations! Now you can start using gulp!

On A Daily Basis
=======

I need to remember that every time I am about to start working on the project, **node** needs to be activated running:

```bash
nvm use
```
