Below you find a list of important information and details, that I use on a daily basis, or I will need in the future when I haven't worked on it for a long time â˜º

### Cloning the repository
To clone the repository open the terminal, go to the projects folder and paste the code below.

`git clone git@github.com:miriamtocino/share-is-evolve.git share-is-evolve`

After that and first of all, the node dependencies need to be installed:

`npm install`

The same with bower:

`bower install`

After this two operations are done, node need to be activated:

`nvm use`

Now gulp is ready to use!

### List of daily used commands ( [word]=placeholder )

Every time I start working on the project, node need to be activated:

`nvm use`

#### gulp
`gulp [taskname]         -> runs the specified task (gulpfile.js)`

`gulp watch              -> starts gulp and runs the watch task`

`gulp clean              -> cleans the dist and _kit folder`

`gulp clear-cache            -> emptys the build cache`

`gulp build              -> makes a build into the dis folder`
